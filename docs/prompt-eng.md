## Current Issues & Solutions

### 1. Inconsistent Ticket Content Fetching
**Problem:**
- AI sometimes skips getting ticket content first
- Provides inconsistent information about the same ticket
- Doesn't follow proper sequence of operations

**Solution:**
1. Enforce strict operation order in prompt:
```
For ANY ticket-related query:
1. MUST get ticket content first using ticket tool
2. Store and reference this content for the entire conversation
3. Only then proceed with additional operations
```

2. Add validation steps:
```
Before responding about a ticket, verify:
- You have fetched the ticket content
- You are using the fetched content in your response
- Any additional information comes from subsequent tool calls
```

### 3. Multi-Step Operation Handling
**Problem:**
- AI doesn't properly sequence complex operations
- Skips steps or performs them in wrong order
- Doesn't maintain context between steps

**Solution:**
1. Define explicit operation chains:
```
For complex queries (e.g., "comment about X from show Y"):
1. Get ticket content (ticket tool)
2. Search for information (search tool)
3. Synthesize information
4. Perform action (e.g., add comment)
5. Confirm action completion
```

2. Add checkpoint system:
```
Between each step:
- Verify previous step completion
- Validate obtained information
- Confirm readiness for next step
```

### 4. Duplicate Tool Usage
**Problem:**
- Performs same tool calls multiple times within single response
- Doesn't maintain in-memory context between steps
- Fails to use information already gathered in current operation

**Solution:**
1. Maintain in-memory context:
```
During multi-step operations:
1. Store results from each tool call in working memory
2. Reference stored data in subsequent steps
3. Pass relevant context between operation steps
Example:
- Ticket info stored after fetching → used for RAG
- RAG results combined with ticket info → used for comment
```

2. Optimize tool usage sequence:
```
For complex operations:
1. Plan complete sequence of needed information
2. Fetch all required data upfront
3. Process/combine information in memory
4. Only make new tool calls for genuinely new information
```

3. Smart data reuse:
```
Within current response:
1. Keep track of what information is already in memory
2. Reference existing data instead of refetching
3. Only refresh data if operation requires latest state
```

### 5. Error Handling
**Problem:**
- Unclear error messages
- No recovery suggestions
- Max iterations without explanation

**Solution:**
1. Standardize error responses:
```
When encountering an error:
1. Identify error type
2. Provide clear explanation in user terms
3. Suggest specific recovery actions
4. Maintain conversation context
```

2. Add error prevention:
```
Before each operation:
1. Validate prerequisites
2. Check for common failure points
3. Prepare fallback options
```

### 6. Inconsistent Tool Usage
**Problem:**
- Inconsistent choice of tools
- Claims actions without performing them
- Skips necessary tool calls

**Solution:**
1. Define strict tool selection rules:
```
Tool Selection Matrix:
- Ticket info → ALWAYS use ticket tool first
- Content queries → ALWAYS use search tool
- Actions (comment/status) → ALWAYS use ticket tool
- Never claim action completion without tool confirmation
```

2. Add verification steps:
```
After each tool use:
1. Verify tool response
2. Confirm action completion
3. Include relevant response details
```

### 7. Response Format Standardization
**Problem:**
- Inconsistent response structures
- Mix of raw data and conversation
- Unclear action confirmations

**Solution:**
1. Define response templates:
```
Standard Response Format:
1. Acknowledgment of request
2. Action taken (with tool used)
3. Result/Information (formatted for readability)
4. Next steps or additional options
```

2. Add context preservation:
```
In each response:
1. Reference relevant ticket numbers
2. Summarize actions taken
3. Maintain conversation thread
```
