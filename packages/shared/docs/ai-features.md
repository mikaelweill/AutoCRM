# AI Features Implementation Progress

## Embeddings (In Progress)

### Current Implementation
- Server-side OpenAI logic in `embeddings.ts`
- Secure API route in `apps/client/src/app/api/embeddings/route.ts`
- Environment setup:
  - OpenAI key in `apps/client/.env.local` (server-side only)
  - No client exposure of API keys

### Completed
- âœ… Basic embedding generation with OpenAI
- âœ… Secure API route setup for embeddings
- âœ… Embedding storage in Supabase
- âœ… Initial ticket embedding on creation
- âœ… Proper separation of client/server code
- âœ… Fixed circular dependency issues
- âœ… Removed unused files (evaluator.ts, rag.ts)

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Comment handling for embeddings
  - Need to update ticket embeddings when comments are added via `addTicketReply`
  - Will use same API route as ticket creation
  - Keep embedding logic server-side only

### Next Steps
1. Modify `addTicketReply` in `tickets.ts` to:
   - Create comment (existing functionality)
   - Call embeddings API to update embedding with new comment
   - Store updated embedding in Supabase

2. Current File Structure:
   ```
   packages/shared/src/lib/ai/
   â”œâ”€â”€ embeddings.ts    # Server-side OpenAI logic
   â””â”€â”€ index.ts         # Clean exports
   
   apps/client/src/app/
   â””â”€â”€ api/
       â””â”€â”€ embeddings/
           â””â”€â”€ route.ts # API endpoint
   ```

### Files Modified
- `packages/shared/src/lib/ai/embeddings.ts`
- `apps/client/src/app/api/embeddings/route.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/services/tickets.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts`

## Future Features
- RAG Implementation
- Ticket Evaluation
- Knowledge Base Integration
