# Agent Production Realtime Investigation

## Executive Summary

### Problem
Agent portal's real-time functionality works in localhost but fails in production, while admin and client portals work in both environments.

### Key Findings
1. **Authentication Works**: JWT claims and user session are correct
2. **WebSocket Issue**: Connection attempts use anon role despite authenticated session
3. **Retry Problems**: Our retry logic caused multiple subscription attempts, making the issue worse

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Auth State: Working (correct JWT claims, session)
- ‚úÖ User Context: Present (correct user ID)
- ‚ùå WebSocket: Failing (connects with anon role)
- ‚ùå Real-time: Not working in production

### Next Action Items
1. Remove problematic retry logic ‚úÖ
2. Investigate WebSocket auth token usage üöß
3. Compare with working portal implementations üöß

## Detailed Investigation

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Localhost: All portals (client, agent, admin) have realtime
- ‚úÖ Production: Client portal has realtime
- ‚úÖ Production: Admin portal has realtime
- ‚ùå Production: Agent portal lacks realtime

## Investigation Timeline

### Initial Setup
1. Compared subscription setup across portals:
   - Admin: Simple setup, no explicit error handling
   - Client: Basic setup with status logging
   - Agent: Enhanced setup with auth check and error handling

### Attempt 1: Enhanced Error Handling
- Added waiting for authenticated user
- Added explicit error handling for CHANNEL_ERROR
- Added retry logic for failed connections
- **Result**: Still failing in production

### Attempt 2: Auth State Analysis
Observed behavior in production:
```javascript
// Initial state correct
JWT Claims: {
  aud: 'authenticated',
  exp: 1737775145,
  // ... correct claims
}

// But WebSocket connects with anon role
WebSocket URL: '.../websocket?apikey=...role=anon...'
```

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Authentication Timing**:
   - Auth state shows INITIAL_SESSION correctly
   - User object is present with correct ID
   - But WebSocket still connects with anon role

2. **Connection Issues**:
   ```
   Setting up subscription for user: [correct-uuid]
   WebSocket connection failed
   Subscription status: CHANNEL_ERROR
   Channel error, will retry for user: [correct-uuid]
   Subscription status: CLOSED
   Error: tried to subscribe multiple times
   ```

3. **Retry Loop Problems**:
   - Retry logic causes multiple subscription attempts
   - Results in "tried to subscribe multiple times" error
   - Subsequent WebSocket connections continue to fail

## Key Differences from Working Portals

### 1. Admin Portal
- Doesn't wait for auth state
- Uses simpler subscription setup
- Works in production despite less robust implementation

### 2. Client Portal
- Similar to admin setup
- No explicit error handling
- Works in production with basic implementation

### 3. Agent Portal (Current)
- Waits for auth state ‚úÖ
- Has error handling ‚úÖ
- Includes retry logic ‚ùå (causing issues)
- Uses authenticated user check ‚úÖ
- Still connects with anon role ‚ùå

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Primary Issue**:
   - WebSocket connection uses anon apikey despite authenticated session
   - Retry logic compounds the problem by creating multiple failed attempts

2. **Contributing Factors**:
   - Auth state might not be fully propagated when WebSocket connects
   - Retry mechanism may be interfering with natural reconnection
   - Multiple subscription attempts causing channel conflicts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Remove retry logic to prevent multiple subscription attempts
2. Investigate why WebSocket uses anon apikey despite authenticated session
3. Compare Supabase client initialization between portals

### Questions to Answer
1. Why does the WebSocket use anon apikey when JWT claims are correct?
2. Why do admin and client portals work with simpler implementation?
3. Is there a timing issue between auth state and WebSocket connection?

### Potential Solutions to Try
1. Delay WebSocket connection until after auth confirmation
2. Simplify to match working portal implementations
3. Investigate Supabase client configuration differences

## Key Findings

### 1. Authentication Flow
- Agent authentication uses `custom_access_token_hook` in PostgreSQL
- Role is stored in both `app_metadata.user_role` and root level `user_role`
- JWT claims are modified to keep role as 'authenticated' for Postgres
- Agent signup requires token validation and correct portal URL

### 2. Realtime Configuration
- Realtime is enabled via `supabase_realtime` publication
- Tables with realtime enabled:
  - `public.tickets`
  - `public.attachments`
  - `public.ticket_activities`
- Replica identity is set to FULL for tickets table

### 3. CORS & Origins
- Strict origin validation in place
- Allowed origins include:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  http://localhost:3001
  http://localhost:3002
  https://auto-crm-client.vercel.app
  https://auto-crm-agent.vercel.app
  https://auto-crm-admin.vercel.app
  ```

## Environment Differences
1. **URLs**:
   - Localhost: `localhost:3000` (client), `localhost:3001` (agent), `localhost:3002` (admin)
   - Production: `auto-crm-client.vercel.app`, `auto-crm-agent.vercel.app`, `auto-crm-admin.vercel.app`

## Potential Areas to Investigate

### 1. Supabase Configuration
- **Realtime Settings**: Check if realtime is enabled for all tables
- **Database Webhooks**: Verify if any webhooks might be interfering
- **Connection Limits**: Check if we're hitting connection limits in production

### 2. Authentication & Policies
- **RLS Policies**: Verify realtime policies for agent role
- **Token Expiration**: Check if agent tokens are expiring differently
- **Role Validation**: Ensure agent role is properly set in auth.users

### 3. Network & CORS
- **CORS Settings**: Verify CORS configuration for agent production URL
- **WebSocket Connection**: Check if WebSocket connections are being blocked
- **SSL/TLS**: Verify SSL certificate issues aren't blocking WebSocket

### 4. Code Differences
- **Subscription Setup**: Compare subscription code across portals
- **Error Handling**: Look for agent-specific error handling
- **Environment Variables**: Check for environment-specific configurations

## Most Likely Hypotheses (Ranked)

1. **JWT Token Role Issue**
   - Why: The `custom_access_token_hook` modifies JWT claims
   - Evidence: Role is set to 'authenticated' for Postgres but user_role in metadata
   - Test: Check if realtime policies correctly interpret the role from JWT

2. **WebSocket Connection**
   - Why: WebSocket might be using different auth context
   - Evidence: Only agent portal in prod is affected
   - Test: Monitor WebSocket connection attempts and JWT token used

3. **RLS Policy Interpretation**
   - Why: Policies might interpret agent role differently
   - Evidence: Works locally but not in prod
   - Test: Compare JWT tokens between local and prod

4. **Supabase Client Configuration**
   - Why: Client setup might differ in prod
   - Evidence: Other portals work fine
   - Test: Compare client initialization between portals

## Action Plan

1. **Verify JWT Token**
   - Check JWT token content in prod agent portal
   - Compare with working local agent portal
   - Look for differences in role claims

2. **Monitor WebSocket**
   - Add logging for WebSocket connection attempts
   - Check if connection uses correct JWT
   - Verify WebSocket URL and headers

3. **Review RLS Policies**
   - Check if policies handle 'authenticated' role correctly
   - Verify agent-specific policies
   - Test policy execution with both role formats

4. **Client Configuration**
   - Compare Supabase client setup across portals
   - Check for environment-specific configurations
   - Verify auth persistence settings

## Questions to Answer
1. What's in the JWT token when connecting to realtime?
2. Does the WebSocket connection include the correct auth headers?
3. Are RLS policies correctly interpreting the agent role?
4. Is the token refresh working correctly in prod?

## Next Steps
1. Add debug logging to WebSocket connection
2. Compare JWT tokens between environments
3. Test policy execution with different role formats
4. Review client initialization differences

## Questions to Answer
1. Are WebSocket connections being initiated?
2. Are connections being rejected?
3. Are there any error messages in the console?
4. What's different about agent authentication?
