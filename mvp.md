# AutoCRM MVP Specification

## Progress Update
‚úÖ = Completed
üöß = In Progress
‚è≥ = Not Started

## 1. User Flows

### Client Flow
1. Authentication
   ‚úÖ Sign up/Sign in with email
   ‚úÖ Redirected to client dashboard

2. Ticket Management
   ‚úÖ Create new ticket
     ‚úÖ Fill form with subject, description, priority
     ‚úÖ Optional: attach files
   ‚úÖ View own tickets
     ‚úÖ List of all tickets with status
     üöß Sort by date, status, priority
   üöß View ticket details
     ‚è≥ See ticket history and updates
     ‚è≥ Add comments/replies
     ‚è≥ View agent responses

### Agent Flow
1. Authentication
   ‚è≥ Sign in (agent accounts created by admin)
   ‚è≥ Redirected to agent dashboard

2. Ticket Management
   ‚è≥ View assigned tickets
   ‚è≥ View ticket queue
   ‚è≥ Ticket Actions

### Admin Flow
‚è≥ All features not started

## 2. Database Schema (Supabase)
‚úÖ profiles
‚úÖ tickets
‚è≥ ticket_activities
‚úÖ attachments

## 3. Key Design Decisions

### Extensibility Features
1. **Metadata Fields**
   ‚úÖ Every table includes metadata JSONB field

2. **Activity Logging**
   ‚è≥ Comprehensive activity tracking
   ‚è≥ Future audit trails and analytics

3. **Attachment System**
   ‚úÖ Separate table for attachments
   ‚úÖ Supports file uploads

   ‚è≥ Agents can view assigned and unassigned tickets
   ‚è≥ Admins have full access

2. **Audit Trail**
   ‚è≥ All changes tracked in ticket_activities

### Performance Considerations
‚úÖ Basic implementation complete
üöß Need to implement sorting and filtering
‚è≥ Pagination support needed

## Next Steps Priority List
1. Implement ticket details view with comments/replies
2. Add sorting and filtering to ticket list
3. Build out agent dashboard and ticket assignment
4. Implement ticket activity logging
5. Add pagination for better performance

## 2. Database Schema (Supabase)

### profiles
```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade primary key,
  email text unique not null,
  full_name text,
  role user_role not null default 'client',
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  last_seen timestamp with time zone,
  metadata jsonb default '{}'::jsonb -- For future extensibility
);

-- Enum for user roles
create type user_role as enum ('client', 'agent', 'admin');

-- RLS Policies will be added for role-based access
```

### tickets
```sql
create table tickets (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  number serial unique, -- For human-readable ticket numbers (#1001, etc.)
  client_id uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  agent_id uuid references profiles(id),
  subject text not null,
  description text not null,
  status ticket_status default 'new',
  priority ticket_priority default 'medium',
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  resolved_at timestamp with time zone,
  metadata jsonb default '{}'::jsonb -- For future extensibility (tags, custom fields, etc.)
);

-- Enums for ticket properties
create type ticket_status as enum ('new', 'in_progress', 'resolved', 'closed');
create type ticket_priority as enum ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent');

-- RLS Policies will be added for role-based access
```

### ticket_activities
```sql
create table ticket_activities (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  ticket_id uuid references tickets(id) on delete cascade not null,
  user_id uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  activity_type activity_type not null,
  content text,
  is_internal boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  metadata jsonb default '{}'::jsonb -- For future extensibility
);

-- Enum for activity types
create type activity_type as enum (
  'comment',
  'status_change',
  'priority_change',
  'agent_assignment',
  'attachment_added'
);

-- RLS Policies will be added for role-based access
```

### attachments
```sql
create table attachments (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  ticket_id uuid references tickets(id) on delete cascade not null,
  user_id uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  file_name text not null,
  file_type text not null,
  file_size integer not null,
  storage_path text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  metadata jsonb default '{}'::jsonb -- For future extensibility
);

-- RLS Policies will be added for role-based access
```

## 3. Key Design Decisions

### Extensibility Features
1. **Metadata Fields**
   - Every table includes a `metadata` JSONB field
   - Allows adding custom fields without schema changes
   - Future-proofs for features like custom ticket fields, user preferences, etc.

2. **Activity Logging**
   - Comprehensive activity tracking
   - Supports future audit trails and analytics
   - Enables future features like ticket timelines

3. **Attachment System**
   - Separate table for attachments
   - Supports future features like file previews, virus scanning
   - Flexible storage path for multiple storage providers

### Security Considerations
1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Clients can only view their own tickets
   - Agents can view assigned and unassigned tickets
   - Admins have full access
   - Activities and attachments inherit ticket permissions

2. **Audit Trail**
   - All changes tracked in ticket_activities
   - Supports future compliance requirements
   - Enables future features like change history

### Performance Considerations
1. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Index on ticket status and agent_id for queue views
   - Index on client_id for client ticket lists
   - Composite indexes for common query patterns

2. **Pagination Support**
   - Serial ticket numbers for efficient pagination
   - Timestamp ordering for activity feeds
   - Supports future infinite scroll implementations
